# OSRuby

A loader for oldschool runescape written in Ruby (JRuby). 

I created this to showcase the application of osrs in other languages. 
Unforutunately I would not be able to recommend JRuby, as it generates java source files from the ruby which have overhead.
However, Ruby is fun to work with and makes writing code easy!
